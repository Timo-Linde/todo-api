# todo-api

The target of this project is to implement a **TODO** api.
A **TODO** has a name and description.
Each **TODO** can have a list of **TASKS** associated with a **TODO**.
Each **TASK** has only a name.
The API provides a mechanism to add and remove **TASKs** from the **TODO** as well as to update individual **TASKS**.
